# Flight-Price-Prediction
We will be analyzing flight fare prediction using a machine learning dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.

Key Takeaways:

1. Learn the complete process of EDA (using a machine learning dataset)

2. Learn to withdraw some insights from the dataset both mathematically and visualize it.

3. Visualising the data to get better insight from it.

4. We will also see what kind of stuff we can do in the feature engineering part.

About the Flight Fare Prediction Dataset

Airline: So this column will have all the types of airlines like Indigo, Jet Airways, Air India, and many more.

Date_of_Journey: This column will let us know about the date on which the passenger’s journey will start.

Source: This column holds the name of the place from where the passenger’s journey will start.

Destination: This column holds the name of the place to where passengers wanted to travel.

Route: Here we can know about that what is the route through which passengers have opted to travel from his/her source to their destination.

Arrival_Time: Arrival time is when the passenger will reach his/her destination.

Duration: Duration is the whole period that a flight will take to complete its journey from source to destination.

Total_Stops: This will let us know in how many places flights will stop there for the flight in the whole journey.

Additional_Info: In this column, we will get information about food, kind of food, and other amenities.

Price: Price of the flight for a complete journey including all the expenses before onboarding.

By employing machine learning algorithms, particularly regression techniques, we aim to predict flight ticket prices accurately. Leveraging Python for data analysis (regression analysis) and utilizing various machine learning models, including linear regression, will allow us to conduct comprehensive flight price prediction analyses. Additionally, with a focus on the Indian aviation market, we can tailor our predictive models to suit the specific dynamics of this region.
